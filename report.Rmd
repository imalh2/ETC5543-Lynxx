# Abstract

# Background

Adelaide's population increased from 1.1 million to 1.3 million residents between 2006 and 2016, with 66 million more kilometers traveled on the road network during that time. Infrastructure Australia paints a dire picture of the level of road congestion in Adelaide and its continued worsening in the coming years in line with both an increasing population and an increasing reliance on public transport in comparison to cars. The report estimated the annualized cost of road congestion for Greater Adelaide to be approximately \$1.4 billion in 2016 and is projected to rise to \$2.6 billion in 2031 (Infrastructure Australia, 2019).

With this backdrop in mind, the client (the South Australia Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT)) has in its possession an untapped wealth of data relating to traffic information collected through Bluetooth probes, which take count of passing motor vehicles in a particular time and location, therefore producing a metric for road congestion.

This data will be examined in conjunction with publicly available, historical real time bus trip updates collected by General Transit Feed Specification Realtime (GTFSr), which provides the arrival time for each stop on a bus's trip. The analysis aims to identify the relationship and robustness of bus travel times to road congestion on road segments of interest.


The aim of the proposed analysis is to investigate the extent of the relationship between bus travel times and road congestion - as measured by motor vehicle travel times - on identified road segments, where a strong relationship indicates a road segment where the bus travel times are less robust to congestion. This will form the basis for future analysis into additional road segments of interest and generating a ranking of bus network robustness, analysing the factors that can effect bus travel times such as the use of bus lanes, and creating a model predicting bus travel times using identified features.
